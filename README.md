Studying the role of cancer stem cells in GBM

This is a computational model of Stem Cells with just a few very basic parameters worth playing with: 
1. the ratio of symmetric vs assymetric divisions for stem cells
2. the number of divisions a Progenitor (Transfer Amplifying Cell) might go through
3. the lifespan of a fully differentiated cell
4. the vascularisation of the tissue

CA2.java contains the Cellular Automaton code and Vis2 contains the visualisation and the main function.
